# Project README

## Description
This project was created using Hardhat, a development environment for Ethereum smart contracts. The goal of this project was to create an NFT (Non-Fungible Token) contract compliant with the ERC721 standard.

## Project Setup
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub.
2. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
3. Install project dependencies by running `npm install` in the project directory.
4. Set up your local development environment, including Ethereum network configuration and accounts. You may use a local test network or connect to an existing Ethereum network for testing and deployment.
5. Modify the necessary configuration files to match your specific network settings.

## Contract Details
The main focus of this project was the implementation of an ERC721 contract for NFTs. ERC721 is a widely used standard for creating unique, indivisible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Each token represents a distinct asset and can be owned and transferred by individuals.

The NFT contract in this project provides the following functionalities:
- Token creation: The contract allows for the creation of new NFTs, each with a unique identifier.
- Token ownership: Tokens can be owned by specific Ethereum addresses, and ownership can be transferred from one address to another.
- Token metadata: The contract stores and exposes metadata associated with each token, such as name, description, and image URL.

## Unit Tests
Unit tests were an essential part of the development process to ensure the correctness and functionality of the NFT contract. These tests were written using a testing framework compatible with Hardhat, such as Mocha or Waffle.

The unit tests cover various scenarios and functionalities of the NFT contract, including:
- Token creation and ownership transfer
- Token metadata retrieval and verification
- Exception handling and error cases

To run the unit tests, execute the following command in the project directory:
```
npx hardhat test
```

## Deployment
To deploy the NFT contract to your chosen Ethereum network, you can utilize Hardhat's deployment capabilities. Modify the deployment scripts to configure the contract parameters and deployment process according to your needs.

To initiate the deployment, run the following command in the project directory:
```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network_name>
```
Replace `<network_name>` with the appropriate network identifier from your Hardhat configuration file.

## Acknowledgments
This project was developed with the help of Hardhat's comprehensive documentation and community resources. Special thanks to the Hardhat development team and the Ethereum community for their valuable contributions.
