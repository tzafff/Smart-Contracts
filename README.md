# Smart Contracts

Welcome to the Smart Contracts repository! This repository contains a collection of smart contract examples and demonstrations for various purposes. It covers a wide range of topics, including ERC20 tokens, ERC721 NFTs, events and Web3.js integration, inheritance and modifiers, and more.

## Directories

- [BasicExamples](https://github.com/tzafff/Smart-Contracts/tree/main/BasicExamples): This directory contains basic examples of smart contracts developed for demonstration and learning purposes. It covers topics such as storage contracts, counters, token contracts, wallet contracts, and more.

- [ERC20 Token Sale](https://github.com/tzafff/Smart-Contracts/tree/main/ERC20%20Token%20Sale): This directory focuses on smart contracts related to an ERC20 token sale. It includes contracts for token sales and example ERC20 token contracts.

- [ERC721 NFT Example](https://github.com/tzafff/Smart-Contracts/tree/main/ERC721%20NFT%20Example): This directory showcases an example of an ERC721 non-fungible token (NFT) contract. It provides an implementation of an NFT contract inspired by the "Bored Ape Yacht Club" project.

- [Events and Web3.js](https://github.com/tzafff/Smart-Contracts/tree/main/Events%20and%20Web3js): This directory demonstrates the integration of events and Web3.js in smart contracts. It includes a contract that emits events and JavaScript files showcasing how to interact with the contract and handle events using Web3.js.

- [Inheritance and Modifiers](https://github.com/tzafff/Smart-Contracts/tree/main/Inheritance%20and%20Modifiers): This directory explores the concepts of inheritance and modifiers in smart contracts. It includes contracts showcasing the usage of the "Ownable" pattern for ownership control and the addition of custom modifiers.

- [Hardhat](https://github.com/tzafff/Smart-Contracts/tree/main/Hardhat): This directory contains smart contracts developed using Hardhat, an Ethereum development environment. Refer to the [README.md](https://github.com/tzafff/Smart-Contracts/blob/main/Hardhat/README.md) file in this directory for more information on the usage and setup.

- [Truffle](https://github.com/tzafff/Smart-Contracts/tree/main/truffle): This directory contains smart contracts developed using Truffle, a popular Ethereum development framework. Refer to the [README.md](https://github.com/tzafff/Smart-Contracts/blob/main/truffle/README.md) file in this directory for more information on the usage and setup.

## Usage

To interact with the smart contracts in this repository, follow the specific instructions provided in each directory's README file. Make sure you have the necessary Ethereum development environment set up, such as Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat, to compile, deploy, and interact with the contracts.
