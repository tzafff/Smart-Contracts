# Events and Web3.js

This directory contains examples related to events and Web3.js integration in smart contracts.

## Contract

### EventExampleWeb3js

The `EventExampleWeb3js.sol` contract demonstrates the usage of events in Solidity, specifically focusing on how to emit events and access event data in JavaScript using the Web3.js library.

## JavaScript and HTML Files

### JavaScriptFile.js

The `JavaScriptFile.js` file showcases an example JavaScript code that interacts with a smart contract deployed on the Ethereum network. It demonstrates how to listen for and handle events emitted by the contract using Web3.js.

### index.html

The `index.html` file represents an example HTML file that includes the necessary scripts to interact with the smart contract using JavaScript and Web3.js. It provides a simple user interface to view and handle events emitted by the contract.

## Usage

To utilize the examples in this directory, follow these steps:

1. Set up an Ethereum development environment with Web3.js, such as Remix or a local development environment.
2. Deploy the `EventExampleWeb3js.sol` contract to an Ethereum network.
3. Update the JavaScript code in `JavaScriptFile.js` with the contract's address and ABI.
4. Customize the `index.html` file as needed, ensuring it references the correct JavaScript file and contract details.
5. Open the HTML file (`index.html`) in a web browser to interact with the smart contract and view emitted events.

Note: Proper configuration of Web3.js and the contract's address and ABI is essential to ensure successful integration and event handling.
