# Basic Examples

This directory contains various basic examples of smart contracts developed for demonstration and learning purposes.

## Contracts

### EventExample

The `EventExample.sol` contract demonstrates the usage of events in Solidity. It showcases how to define events with parameters and data types, emit events, and access event data.

### ExampleMappingWithdrawals

The `ExampleMappingWithdrawals.sol` contract showcases the use of mappings to implement a simple withdrawal pattern. It demonstrates how to manage balances and enable users to withdraw their funds.

### ExampleWithEventLogs

The `ExampleWithEventLogs.sol` contract illustrates the usage of event logs. It showcases emitting events and logging them into the transaction logs, allowing external systems to access and process event data.

### ExceptionsExample

The `ExceptionsExample.sol` contract demonstrates different exception scenarios and exception handling techniques in Solidity. It showcases how to handle exceptions and recover from failures within smart contracts.

### LowLevelFunctions

The `LowLevelFunctions.sol` contract provides examples of low-level functions in Solidity. It showcases the usage of assembly code to perform low-level operations such as bitwise operations and interacting with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

### MappingsStructExample

The `MappingsStructExample.sol` contract showcases the usage of mappings and structs in Solidity. It demonstrates how to define mappings and structs, store data using mappings, and access struct elements.

### SampleWallet

The `SampleWallet.sol` contract is a simple example of a multi-signature wallet implementation. It showcases how multiple parties can collectively manage and approve transactions using a smart contract.

### SendWithdrawMoney

The `SendWithdrawMoney.sol` contract provides an example of sending and withdrawing money in Solidity. It demonstrates how to send and receive Ether, manage balances, and perform secure withdrawals.

### SimpleSendMoney

The `SimpleSendMoney.sol` contract illustrates a basic example of sending money in Solidity. It showcases how to send Ether from one address to another using the `send` and `transfer` functions.

### StructExample

The `StructExample.sol` contract demonstrates the usage of structs in Solidity. It showcases how to define and utilize structs to represent complex data structures within smart contracts.

### TryCatchExamples

The `TryCatchExamples.sol` contract provides examples of try-catch exception handling in Solidity. It demonstrates how to catch and handle exceptions using the `try` and `catch` keywords.
